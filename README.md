Using this project to generate a neural network from scratch in Rust.

The program will allow a use to set a number of parameters for their neural network, train the network, and store the parameter file at a location of their choosing.

By creating this project, the goal is to teach myself all steps of neural networks from scratch, while testing various Rust libraries that may optimize the training runtimes of these models such as: ndarray.
